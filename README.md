### Ideas

- Random chunks of sine waves
- Rudimentury instruments based on main overtones
- Human voice instrument
- Maybe animal noises? 
- A way to pass overtones and get "instrument"
- adding noise 
    - random/white/pink
    - gaussian
    - other?

### TODO
- think about how to get functions that generate different types of arrays of audio (12-bits? 44100hz?)
